# Face Attraction

Remote sound interaction with Processing and Supercollider. Processing tracks your eyes, eyebrowns and mouth check the position and send OSC messages to 
Supercollider in order to react and modify sound based on your head movement. You can test it in local mode with local server but in order to test with other 
person outside from your local network we used hamachi which gives you a VPN with an new IP, you'll have to configure this new IP in both Processing and 
Supercollider.
